This is a file for monte carlo programmes. The first folder (pi) guesses the calue of pi using the montecarlo integration method. The second folder (ln2) guesses the value of ln2 by integration of 1/x btween the limits 1 and 2. The third uses the summation method instead of monte carlo for finding pi, using a Euler series.

A monte carlo method effectively integrates by taking random numbers between the limit and adding the points if they are within the curve, this will eventually converge to the required number.
